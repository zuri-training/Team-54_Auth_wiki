# INTRODUCTION 
This is the official repository for Team 54. Our aim is to create a website/platform where users can have access and download authenticated codes for their required needs.


## Project Overview

A library of authentication codes is a collection of codes that can be used to verify an individual's identity. The purpose of the library will be to reduce stress, save time, organize codes, and make it easier for its users to achieve their goals.


## The Problem

The problem at hand and that which we are trying to tackle is non-authenticated users having access to discrete information and services that only authenticated users should have.


## Project Goal

Our aim is to create a website/platform where users can have access and download authenticated codes for their required needs. The platform would have;
a section for organized codes so as to make it easier for users to access and download.
examples of codes, what each code works for, and how each code works.
The library will also aim at improving community interactions.
